# SortVisualizer
A visualization of different sorting algorithms.

# Building
A make file is provided to build the application. Personally, I use the g++ compiler, but you can edit the makefile to better suit your needs.

# Usage
The application presents colored bars that represent numbers 1 to N. To use the application a number of hotkeys are provided.
|Hotkey|Description|
|------|-----------|
|Q|Performs Bubble Sort|
|W|Performs Merge Sort|
|R|Shuffles the array|
